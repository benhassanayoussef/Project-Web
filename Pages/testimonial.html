            Studying at the International Institute of Technology (IIT) has greatly helped me strengthen my fundamental
            knowledge in computer engineering while allowing me to learn many new technical and practical skills. Through
            courses and projects, I improved my problem-solving abilities and gained valuable experience in teamwork. 
            Working with classmates on different projects also helped me develop communication skills and build strong 
            relationships. In addition, IIT provided me with a supportive learning environment where I was able to make new 
            friends and grow both academically and personally.
